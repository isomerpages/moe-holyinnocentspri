## 家长志工团队<br> Parent Support Group


The Parent Support Group (PSG) executive committee was first formed in 2000 with a small group of members. Since then, with the strong support and commitment from dedicated parent volunteers, the committee members, Principal, Vice-Principals and the teachers, the committee has grown from strength to strength. Currently, the PSG has 12 committee members.&nbsp;

#### Activities

**GIFT - Growing in Faith Together**  
Led by our Chaplain, the GIFT volunteers and teachers have developed programmes for students at the different levels. Topics such as the lives of Saints and the Gift of the Holy Spirit are shared during these sessions.&nbsp;&nbsp;The GIFT programme is not a substitute for the Catechism programme conducted in the parishes.&nbsp;  

Since the pandemic, GIFT lessons are online via the Student Learning Space, and are interactive using videos, activities and songs.&nbsp; Regular prayers such as the daily Guardian Angel Prayer and student-led Rosary prayer in May and October anchor our students in faith.
