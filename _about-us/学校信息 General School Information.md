<p>This means that during these periods, vehicles are not allowed to enter
through St Anthony’s Vehicles’ Gate (Gate A). These restrictions help manage
student safety and traffic flow during key times, such as school’s dismissal.</p>

<p>For the safety of your child, please ensure that your child do not alight
along Lorong Low Koon and Upper Serangoon Road. Adherence to the instructions
of HIPS traffic wardens to ensure a smooth flow of traffic will be greatly
appreciated.</p>
