## PARENT SUPPORT GROUP

![](/images/PSG.jpeg)

The Parent Support Group (PSG) executive committee was first formed in 2000 with a small group of members. Since then, with the strong support and commitment from dedicated parent volunteers, the committee members, Principal, Vice-Principals and the teachers, the committee has grown from strength to strength. Currently, the PSG has 13 committee members.
