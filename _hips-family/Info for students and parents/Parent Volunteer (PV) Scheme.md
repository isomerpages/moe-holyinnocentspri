<font size="+1">Parent Volunteer Registration for **2024 Primary 1** admission is now **CLOSED.**

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

1. Child must be a Singapore Citizen or a Singapore Permanent Resident.

2. Parents may begin their registration one year prior to the year of the Primary One Registration Exercise. Late applications, after the Parent Volunteer Registration period, will not be considered.

3. Selection is not on a first-come, first-served basis. The school reserves the right to select volunteers who are willing and able to perform their duties during working days and are able to meet the needs of the school. Interviews will be held for shortlisted applicants only. The school will not entertain any telephone calls made during the selection period. All unsuccessful applicants will be notified by email by the end of May. The decision of the school is final and the school is not obliged to provide any reason for unsuccessful applications.

4. Selected parents must voluntarily serve and complete at least 40 hours of service in the school by 31 May of the year of the Primary One Registration Exercise. Both parents can contribute to the 40 hours. The school shall not be held responsible for Parent Volunteers who are unable to meet the minimum 40 hours of service. PVs who have not completed the minimum of 40 hours by the end May of the year of registration, will automatically be disqualified from the scheme and will not be able to register under Phase 2B during the P1 registration exercise.

PVs who wish to terminate their involvement while they are in the scheme, have to submit a withdrawal request to the officer in-charge at [holyinnocentspri@moe.edu.sg](mailto:holyinnocentspri@moe.edu.sg).

For a child who is a Singapore Citizen, parents must provide a copy of the following:

*  Child’s Birth Certificate or Singapore Citizenship Certificate (if child is not Singapore Citizen by birth)

* Parents’ Singapore NRIC or Entry / Re-Entry Permit (if parents do not possess Singapore NRIC)

For a child who is a Permanent Resident, parents must provide a copy of:

* Child’s Birth Certificate

* Child’s Entry / Re-Entry Permit

* Parents’ Singapore NRIC or Entry / Re-Entry Permit (if parents do not possess Singapore NRIC)

ALL PVs will be subject to balloting should the number of applicants be greater than the available vacancies during Phase 2B registration. In the event of balloting, Singapore Citizens will be given priority over Permanent Residents.
