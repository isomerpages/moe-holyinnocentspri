## School Crest

<img style="width: 55%;" src="/images/School%20Crest.jpeg" align = "center" /> 

<center> Our school crest is shaped like a shield with a cross at the centre.

<br>

The shield represents the defence of our faith.

  

The Cross at the centre signifies the centre place of Christ in our lives.

  

The red coloured cross symbolises the blood of Christ and serves to remind us of the supreme sacrifice of Christ for all mankind.

  

The colour blue, which outlines the shield, symbolises the ever soothing presence of our Mother Mary who is always there for us.

  

The colour white symbolises sincerity and charity.</center>
