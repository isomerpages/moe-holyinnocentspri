## School Crest

<img style="width: 55%;" src="/images/School%20Crest.jpeg" align = "center" /> 

<center> Our school crest is shaped like a shield with a cross at the centre.</center>



<center>The shield represents the defence of our faith.</center>

  

<center>The Cross at the centre signifies the centre place of Christ in our lives.</center>

  

<center>The red coloured cross symbolises the blood of Christ and serves to remind us of the supreme sacrifice of Christ for all mankind.</center>

  

<center>The colour blue, which outlines the shield, symbolises the ever soothing presence of our Mother Mary who is always there for us.</center>

  

<center>The colour white symbolises sincerity and charity.</center>
