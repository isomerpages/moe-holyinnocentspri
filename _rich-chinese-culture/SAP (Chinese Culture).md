#### HIPS SAP Programme

As a SAP school, HIPS is committed to nurture bilingual and bi-cultural students with a deeper understanding of the Chinese Language and a passion for Chinese culture. Students are immersed in enriched learning through the structured Flagship Performing Arts Programme, which includes Kuaiban Programme and Chinese Opera, that seeks to nurture their appreciation of the performing arts as well as develop in them confidence in language expression. The outward expression of the students’ language ability is supported by the appreciation of Chinese culture through the Cultural Arts Programme modules of Wushu, Weiqi, Tea Art, Chinese Calligraphy, Chinese Brush Painting and Traditional Chinese Medicine.
