### Mission


To empower students to be appreciative, competent and effective English Language users

### Approach


Our students learn to appreciate the English language and develop their creative, and critical thinking skills in an environment that supports each student voice. The use of thinking routines and Philosophy for Children enable this to happen. Plenty of opportunities are provided for our students to present and share what they have read with their classmates.Â
