## Mathematics Department

#### Vision


To develop students to be independent and effective mathematical problem solvers and to nurture in them a spirit of collaboration and continuous learning in an enjoyable learning environment.

#### Mission


Each child an effective and confident problem solver and a dynamic independent learner.

#### Strategies


**1\. Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (CPA) approach**

A key Maths pedagogy at HIPS is the Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (C-P-A) approach, which enables students to encounter Maths in a meaningful way and translate concepts from the concrete to the abstract. The CPA approach helps children learn new ideas and build on their existing knowledge by introducing abstract concepts in a more familiar way through concrete and pictorial modes.

As such, hands-on activities and learning experiences are conducted to help students learn concepts through self-exploration, discussions, and collaborative learning.

**2\. Polya’s 4-Step Problem Solving approach**

Another key Maths pedagogy at HIPS is the use of Polya’s 4-Step Problem Solving approach, which is a structured method that guides students in effective problem-solving. Teachers enhance classroom discourse through effective questioning and routines in visible thinking such as Talk Moves.

 In class, these talk moves are used to support mathematical thinking and reasoning and drive student discussions. This is especially important when students are trying to clarify their own thinking and share ideas with each other.

 A Process Thinking Skills (PTS) Package is also designed to provide a structured approach to enhance the students’ problem-solving skills through the use of heuristics.
