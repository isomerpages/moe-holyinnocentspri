To help our students thrive in a fast-changing world, we have identified competencies that have become increasingly important in the 21st century. These competencies, as outlined in the Framework for 21st Century Competencies and Student Outcomes, illustrate the holistic education that our school provides to better prepare our students for the future.

**The Inquiry Process :**

Inquiry-based learning in the classroom embodies these elements and takes on various possible forms, including those that are more process-oriented and those that are discussion oriented. The inquiry approach used in Social Studies also encompasses an appreciation of the roles and responsibilities of the teacher and student in a classroom culture that would be conducive to inquiry.

The inquiry process can be characterised by four aspects:

·         Sparking Curiosity

·         Gathering Data

·         Exercising Reasoning

·         Reflective Thinking

Social Studies ignites curiosity about real-world issues. It helps students to understand and developments that are taking place in society and the world as well as their roles in shaping the future of the nation.
