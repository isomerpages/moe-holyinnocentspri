## Student Development

#### Core Department Beliefs


To discipline is to care.

Every child is a leader.

      The Student Development Department looks after 2 main aspects of the holistic development of our  students - **Behavioural Well-Being** and **Student Leadership Development**.  

#### Behavioural Well-Being


The school adopts a **Win-Win Discipline** approach towards classroom management where we handle discipline challenges at the moment of the disruption with powerful and proven discipline strategies; but more importantly, it targets the root of discipline challenges—students' unfulfilled needs. We also adopt **Restorative Practices (RP)** and have worked towards establishing a restorative culture within the school setting, where positive relationships are developed among all stakeholders of the school. Therefore, the department strives to create a **safe** and **caring** school environment where positive **teacher-student relationship (TSR)** and **peer relationship (PR)** are built.
