#### Quality Character and Citizenship Education to nurture Caring Hearts


Quality Character and Citizenship Education grounds students in moral values and nurtures them in their leadership and social-emotional competencies. These meaningful and well-designed school experiences will help our students grow in leading themselves and the school, and eventually, serve to the community and nation.

The **HIPS Values-In-Action (VIA) Framework** aims to support the school in developing students with the will to act for the betterment of the school, community and nation. Through the course of students’ six years at HIPS, we will instill in them an understanding of the school values and equip them with the tools necessary to enact change in society as a student with a Caring Heart. Students’ VIA experiences will leverage on the Character and Citizenship Education learning outcomes to ensure student-centricity, intentionality and  coherence.  

#### Adopting a Design Thinking Approach


The framework is anchored on the school’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP) Design Thinking Approach and progressively develops students across the 5 stages, Empathy, Define, Ideate, Prototype and Test through a segmented approach.

**At lower primary level, students will focus on the first 2 stages.**

1.      Empathy – Students will focus on understanding the needs of the selected target group. 

2.    Define – Students will focus on defining the needs of the target group based on the insights gathered from the empathy stage and attempt to address these needs.

**At middle primary level, students will focus on the middle stage.**

1.      Ideate – Students will work in teams to brainstorm and develop creative solutions to address the needs of the user.

**At the upper primary level, students will focus on the last 2 stages.**

1.       Prototype – Students will build representations of one or more of their proposed solutions.

2.     Test – Students will share, test and implement their proposed solutions, to the proposed target group, for feedback.
