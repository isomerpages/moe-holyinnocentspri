## Character & Citizenship Education

#### School/Department Vision


**Caring Hearts**

The CCE department’s vision of Caring Hearts is fleshed out from our school’s vision and supports the first vision outcome of **Caring Hearts, Creative Minds**. Aligned to our culture of care and excellence, the whole-school CCE implementation anchors on equipping our pupils with a sound moral compass, through the teaching and inculcation of knowledge, skills and values, to navigate the world around them. We hope that through our CCE programmes, our pupils will develop holistically and grow up to become caring individuals and concerned citizens with an aptitude to serve.

#### Department Mission


To nurture our pupils into caring individuals with a strong moral compass

#### Approach


The school adopts the Live it, Act on it, Pass it on (L.A.P) approach to realise the CCE outcomes. Explicit teaching of the values and competencies is woven into the formal and informal curriculum and integrated into every aspect of the pupils’ school experience. Authentic learning platforms and opportunities are created for pupils to internalise the learning through application and reflection on what has been taught. We want our pupils to progress from personal mastery (Live it) to application (Act on it) of these life skills and eventually impacting the wider community (Pass it on).
