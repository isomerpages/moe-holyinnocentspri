## Character & Citizenship Education

#### School/Department Vision


**Caring Hearts**

The CCE department’s vision of Caring Hearts is fleshed out from our school’s vision and supports the first vision outcome of **Caring Hearts, Creative Minds**. Aligned to our culture of care and excellence, the whole-school CCE implementation anchors on equipping our pupils with a sound moral compass, through the teaching and inculcation of knowledge, skills and values, to navigate the world around them. We hope that through our CCE programmes, our pupils will develop holistically and grow up to become caring individuals and concerned citizens with an aptitude to serve.

#### Department Mission


To nurture our pupils into caring individuals with a strong moral compass
