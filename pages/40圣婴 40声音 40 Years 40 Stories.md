<h4><strong>Homecoming and Mid-Autumn Carnival (2 Oct 2025)</strong></h4>
<p>The school will also continue the festivities with the Mid-Autumn Festival
celebrated in conjunction with our 40th Anniversary Homecoming Carnival
on <strong>2 October 2025 (Thursday)</strong> that will be taking place between <strong>4 pm to 8 pm</strong>,
making the occasion especially meaningful as past and present members of
our school community come together. To enhance students’ understanding
of Chinese traditions, booths will be set up during the carnival, featuring
fun games, hands-on activities, and cultural exhibits. Leading up to the
day, students will also enjoy activities during lesson time from the start
of Term 4, with cultural exhibits displayed in the canteen and library
over the next two weeks. They are encouraged to explore these displays
and borrow festival-themed books to deepen their appreciation of the festival.</p>
<p>Parents and Alumni, please do mark down <strong>2 October 2025 (Thursday)</strong>,
for this special occasion, and stay tuned for more information in the weeks
ahead as we share details on how the celebrations will unfold.</p>

<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>In celebration of Holy Innocent’s Primary School's 40th Anniversary, we
will be raising funds to set up an outdoor theatre at our Holy Family Garden.
This will be the distinctive feature of HIPS where our children get to
learn, while understanding our distinctive SAP Culture and spend quiet
time to worship there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please share with your family &amp; friends to join in this cause to make
this possible.&nbsp; All donations above $300 will be Tax-Deductible.</p>
<p>Thank you for your support and generosity in advance.</p>
