<h4><strong>Purple Parade</strong></h4>
<p>As part of our school’s annual purple parade where we support inclusion
and celebrate the abilities of persons with disabilities, student learning
experiences will be designed to help develop in our students cognitive
and emotional empathy and become more sensitive to the social environment
and needs of others. We would like to encourage all students to come in
purple on 10 November 2025, Monday, as we mark the day with purpose.</p>

<h4><strong>P1 2026 Orientation Day - </strong>19 Nov 2025</h4>
<p>The Orientation Day for P1 2026 students will be conducted on <strong>19 November 2025 (Wednesday) </strong>morning.
As such, all P1 to P6 students are <strong>NOT</strong> required to attend
school on that day.</p>

<h4><strong>ALBA's Battery Recycling Challenge</strong> (1 March 2025 to 28 February 2026)</h4>
<p>Our school is proud to take part in this year-long recycling initiative.
We have set up collection points at our school's Green Hub, where grey
recycling bins are available for AA, AAA, AAAA, square, and button batteries.
This programme not only helps recover valuable materials such as zinc,
steel, and manganese but also prevents harmful substances from entering
our environment through improper disposal. We encourage you to pass your
child/ward the used batteries for this recycling initiative.</p>
