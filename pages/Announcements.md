<h4><strong>Teachers' Day Celebration</strong></h4>
<p>
<br>It’s the time of the year again! We are excited to be celebrating Teachers’
Day on <strong>29 August 2024</strong>, <strong>Thursday</strong>. There
will be no lessons during school hours as we anticipate a meaningful time
of celebrating the day in honour of our teachers. Please be informed of
the early school dismissal time at <strong>10.30 am</strong>. There will
be <strong>no school on Friday, 30 August 2024</strong>.
<br>
<br>This year, the theme for our Teachers’ Day celebration is, <strong><em>Planting Seeds of Change</em></strong>.
To enhance the celebrative atmosphere at school, we wish to encourage our
students to come to school in green t-shirts or clothes with plant prints.

<p>Please refer to PG letters for any other update.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
