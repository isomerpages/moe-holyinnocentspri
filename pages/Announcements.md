<h3><strong>Racial Harmony Celebration</strong></h3>
<p>The school will be commemorating Racial Harmony Day (RHD) on Monday, 21
July 2025. This meaningful occasion invites our students to reflect on
and celebrate Singapore’s success as a harmonious society, built upon the
rich tapestry of our cultural diversity.</p>
<p>This year’s RHD theme, <strong><em>Our People, Our Tapestry</em></strong>,
encourages appreciation of the diverse and unique communities that shape
our multicultural identity, and highlights the importance of building a
cohesive Singapore through mutual respect in our everyday interactions.</p>
<p>Through such commemorative events, we hope to inspire our students to
forge strong relationships across different cultures and communities, strengthening
the shared identity we all hold as Singaporeans.</p>
<p>As part of the celebration, students are encouraged to come dressed in
traditional ethnic attire representing the Malay, Indian, or Eurasian communities
on Monday, 21 July 2025.</p>

<h3><strong>Student Well-being</strong></h3>
<p>In view of the persistent hot weather, in the interest of students’ well-being,
students are allowed to be in their Physical Education (PE) attire daily
till further notice. The school will monitor and review the situation again.
Please continue to ensure that your child is neatly attired for school,
keep well, and stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water throughout the
day.</p>

<h3><strong>ALBA's Battery Recycling Challenge</strong> (1 March 2025 to 28 February 2026)</h3>
<p>Our school is proud to take part in this year-long recycling initiative.
We have set up collection points at our school's Green Hub, where grey
recycling bins are available for AA, AAA, AAAA, square, and button batteries.
This programme not only helps recover valuable materials such as zinc,
steel, and manganese but also prevents harmful substances from entering
our environment through improper disposal. We encourage you to pass your
child/ward the used batteries for this recycling initiative.</p>
