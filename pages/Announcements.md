<h3><strong>Earth Hour</strong> - 22 March 2025, 8.30 pm to 9.30 pm</h3>
<p>This year's Earth Hour theme, "Shine a Light on Climate Action," encourages
us all to reduce energy consumption and advocate for stronger climate policies
and sustainable solutions. We will be inviting our students to participate
in this event by turning off non-essential lights at home for one hour
and to capture their experience through photos or videos. We warmly invite
you to join in this meaningful activity with your child/ward, demonstrating
how small actions can contribute to a larger cause.</p>

<h3><strong>ALBA's Battery Recycling Challenge</strong> (1 March 2025 to 28 February 2026)</h3>
<p>Our school is proud to take part in this year-long recycling initiative.
We have set up collection points at our school's Green Hub, where grey
recycling bins are available for AA, AAA, AAAA, square, and button batteries.
This programme not only helps recover valuable materials such as zinc,
steel, and manganese but also prevents harmful substances from entering
our environment through improper disposal. We encourage you to pass your
child/ward the used batteries for this recycling initiative.</p>
