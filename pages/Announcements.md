#### **Teachers' Day Celebration**
<br>
It’s the time of the year again! We are excited to be celebrating Teachers’ Day on **29 August 2024**, 
**Thursday**. There will be no lessons during school hours as we anticipate a meaningful time of 
celebrating the day in honour of our teachers. Please be informed of the early school dismissal time 
at **10.30 am**. There will be **no school on Friday, 30 August 2024**.
<br><br>
This year, the theme for our Teachers’ Day celebration is, ***Planting Seeds of Change***. To enhance 
the celebrative atmosphere at school, we wish to encourage our students to come to school in 
green t-shirts or clothes with plant prints.
<br>

Please refer to PG letters for any other update.

Thank you.
