<h3><strong>Use Your Hands Campaign (28 May 2025)</strong></h3>
<p>In line with the Keep Singapore Clean movement, all students will be participating
in the Use Your Hands Campaign on Wednesday, 28 May 2025. We hope to inculcate
in our students a sense of social responsibility, graciousness and appreciation
for their parents, domestic helpers and cleaners who help clean their home,
school and community. Students will be assigned duties within their classrooms
and common areas such as the Computer and Science Labs, Art, Music and
Dance Studios etc. Students will also be assigned a holiday assignment,
to do their part in the community to Keep Singapore Clean. More information
will be shared via your child’s SLS.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Students should come to school in their PE attire on this day. The form
teacher will inform their students what they need to bring for this exercise.
We thank you for your support.</p>

<h3><strong>ALBA's Battery Recycling Challenge</strong> (1 March 2025 to 28 February 2026)</h3>
<p>Our school is proud to take part in this year-long recycling initiative.
We have set up collection points at our school's Green Hub, where grey
recycling bins are available for AA, AAA, AAAA, square, and button batteries.
This programme not only helps recover valuable materials such as zinc,
steel, and manganese but also prevents harmful substances from entering
our environment through improper disposal. We encourage you to pass your
child/ward the used batteries for this recycling initiative.</p>
