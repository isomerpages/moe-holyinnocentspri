<h4><strong>Use Your Hands Campaign</strong></h4>
<p>To encourage our students to be active contributors, all students will
be participating in the Use Your Hands Campaign on Tuesday, <strong>18 November 2025</strong>.
The Use Your Hands Campaign is a bi-annual school-based activity which
aims to instill a sense of responsibility in students to maintain the cleanliness
of their learning spaces. Through this campaign, we hope to develop empathetic
students with an appreciation for their parents, domestic helpers and cleaners
who help keep the spaces they use clean. Students will be assigned to clean
areas within the school such as their classrooms, special rooms, canteen
and hall.</p>
<p>Students are required to come to school in their P.E. Attire and bring
a rag with them for cleaning purposes. More information will be shared
with students on Monday, 17 November 2025.</p>

<h4><strong>2026 Orientation Programme – HIPS HURRAY!</strong></h4>
<p>As part of our continued emphasis on character education, the school will
be conducting the HIPS HURRAY! Programme when school reopens. The programme
will be held from <strong>5 to 7 January 2026 </strong>and aims to nurture
our students’ values as well as their social and emotional competencies
through engaging and structured activities. These include ice-breaker games,
the co-creation of classroom rules, and team-building activities, conducted
with appropriate safety measures in place.</p>
<p>Through this programme, we hope to strengthen our students’ sense of belonging
to the school and foster positive relationships between teachers and students.
Your child/ward is encouraged to bring a small bag containing a storybook,
a water bottle, and basic stationery. Please note that the regular curriculum
will resume on <strong>Thursday, 8 January 2026</strong>.</p>

<h4><strong>ALBA's Battery Recycling Challenge</strong> (1 March 2025 to 28 February 2026)</h4>
<p>Our school is proud to take part in this year-long recycling initiative.
We have set up collection points at our school's Green Hub, where grey
recycling bins are available for AA, AAA, AAAA, square, and button batteries.
This programme not only helps recover valuable materials such as zinc,
steel, and manganese but also prevents harmful substances from entering
our environment through improper disposal. We encourage you to pass your
child/ward the used batteries for this recycling initiative.</p>
