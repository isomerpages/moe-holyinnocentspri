<h4><strong>Children’s Day Celebration - 2 Oct 2025</strong></h4>
<p>On 2 October 2025, the school will be celebrating Children’s Day in the
morning. This year’s theme is “<strong><em>I am a Star</em></strong>”.
Students need not wear their school uniform; instead, they are encouraged
to come dressed in colourful attire to mark the occasion in a vibrant spirit.</p>
<p>As part of the celebrations, and in conjunction with our Teacup Challenge
for the school’s 40th Anniversary, students will also be treated to a surprise
snack. Please note that only two stalls in the canteen will be operating,
so students are reminded to bring along their own snack and water bottle.
They are also encouraged to carry a storybook and some stationery with
colouring materials in a small bag. Staggered dismissal for all levels
will follow thereafter.</p>

and needs of others. We would like to encourage all students to come in
purple on 10 November 2025, Monday, as we mark the day with purpose.</p>

<h4><strong>ALBA's Battery Recycling Challenge</strong> (1 March 2025 to 28 February 2026)</h4>
<p>Our school is proud to take part in this year-long recycling initiative.
We have set up collection points at our school's Green Hub, where grey
recycling bins are available for AA, AAA, AAAA, square, and button batteries.
This programme not only helps recover valuable materials such as zinc,
steel, and manganese but also prevents harmful substances from entering
our environment through improper disposal. We encourage you to pass your
child/ward the used batteries for this recycling initiative.</p>
