<h3><strong>Total Defence Day</strong></h3>
<p>The school will be commemorating Total Defence Day on 10 February 2025
as a reminder of the need to defend Singapore and strengthen our resolve
to keep our nation safe, secure and sovereign. Total Defence remains relevant
to deal with the ever-evolving threats and challenges to Singapore. Thus,
it is crucial we inform our students how our nation approach an all-round
response to these threats and challenges. This involves all Singaporeans
to play a part, individually and collectively, to build a strong, secure
and cohesive nation.</p>
<p>The theme for this year is “Together We Keep Singapore Strong”, focusing
on Singaporean’s readiness for crises and disruptions, and the many ways
we can put Total Defence into action in our everyday lives. This year also
marks our 40 years of Total Defence in Singapore since it was first introduced
in 1984. We will focus our efforts on educating Singaporean youth on the
ever-evolving hybrid threats and challenges to Singapore. These include
misinformation, supply chain disruptions and food security that affect
communities and Singaporeans’ way of life.</p>
<p>To mark this milestone, the conduct of the Exercise SG Ready 2025 will
be held at HIPS on 17 February 2025 to increase students’ readiness for
crises and disruptions. The school will simulate an Energy Disruption Exercise
in which the school will switch off electricity, except for critical areas,
for at least an hour.</p>
