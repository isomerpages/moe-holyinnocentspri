<h4><strong>Racial Harmony Celebration</strong></h4>
<p></p>
<p>The school will be commemorating Racial Harmony Day on <strong>Monday, 15 July 2024</strong>.
It is a day for our students to reflect and celebrate the nationâ€™s success
as a harmonious society, built on our cultural diversity. Similar to previous
years, the RHD theme, <strong><em>Singapore: Our Multicultural Mosaic</em></strong>,
focuses on the appreciation of the diverse races and religions that make
up our multicultural society, towards building a cohesive Singapore in
our daily living with one another.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Through the commemoration of events such as RHD, we hope to encourage
our youth to cultivate strong relationships with diverse individuals and
groups as we continue to strengthen the collective identity of Singaporeans.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Students are encouraged to dress in the traditional costumes of the Malay,
Eurasian and Indian ethnic races on <strong><u>Monday, 15 July 2024</u></strong>.</p>
