<h3><strong>National Day Celebration </strong>-<strong> </strong>Building Our Singapore Together</h3>
<p>Our school will be celebrating National Day on <strong>8 August 2025, Friday</strong> from
7.30 am to 10.30 am. Please note the attire on that day is a <strong>red T-shirt</strong>, <strong>school PE shorts</strong>,
white socks and school shoes for all levels. The timetable will be suspended
as we celebrate this significant occasion in nation-building.</p>
<p>Our lower primary students will be participating in a series of exciting
and purposeful activities, designed not only for fun, but also to allow
them to apply essential Physical Education skills in a vibrant, real-world
setting. Through friendly relay competition, teamwork, and encouragement,
our young learners will exemplify the spirit of sportsmanship and resilience.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, our upper primary students will experience a vibrant event
that blends traditional and modern National Education (NE) games. This
immersive experience allows them to connect with Singapore’s rich heritage
while embracing innovation and progress. Through these meaningful interactions,
our students will deepen their appreciation of Singapore’s journey and
the contributions of generations past and present.</p>
<p>As school will end at 10.30 am, only the drink stall will be open. Students
are encouraged to have breakfast before coming to school and bring their
water bottles. They are also encouraged to bring some stationery in a small
bag.</p>

<h3><strong>Teachers’ Day Celebration</strong></h3>
<p>It’s the time of the year again! We are excited to be celebrating Teachers’

day in honour of our teachers. Please be informed of the early school dismissal
time at 10.30 am. There will be no school on 5 September 2025, Friday.</p>
<p>This year, the theme for our Teachers’ Day celebration is, “Stars of Our
Lives”. To enhance the celebrative atmosphere at school, we wish to encourage
our students to come to school in shades of blue t-shirts or clothes.</p>
<p>In view of the early school dismissal, only two stalls in the school canteen
will be operating. Students are reminded to pack their own snack and bring
their water bottle. Students are also encouraged to bring a story book

<h3><strong>ALBA's Battery Recycling Challenge</strong> (1 March 2025 to 28 February 2026)</h3>
<p>Our school is proud to take part in this year-long recycling initiative.
We have set up collection points at our school's Green Hub, where grey
recycling bins are available for AA, AAA, AAAA, square, and button batteries.
This programme not only helps recover valuable materials such as zinc,
steel, and manganese but also prevents harmful substances from entering
our environment through improper disposal. We encourage you to pass your
child/ward the used batteries for this recycling initiative.</p>

<p><em>Thank you.</em>
