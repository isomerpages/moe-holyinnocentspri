<h4><strong>2. Children’s Day Celebration</strong></h4>
<p>The school will be celebrating Children’s Day on <strong>3 October 2024, Thursday</strong>.
This year’s theme for the celebrations is, ‘<strong><em>I am a Star</em></strong>’.
Students need not wear their school uniforms on that day and are instead,
encouraged to come dressed in colourful attire to celebrate the day in
vibrant spirit.</p>
<p>Only two stalls in the school canteen will be operating so students are
reminded to pack their own snack and bring their water bottle. Students
are also encouraged to bring a story book and some stationery in a small
bag with them.</p>
<p>There is no school on Children’s Day, which is a scheduled school holiday,
on 4 October 2024, Friday.</p>
