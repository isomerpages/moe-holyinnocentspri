<h4>2.  World Water Day (Friday, 22 March)</h4>
<p>The United Nations has designated <strong>22 March</strong> as World Water
Day to celebrate and raise awareness on the importance of water.</p>
<p>The theme for this year’s World Water Day is ‘Water for Peace’. By adopting
water-saving habits and using only what we need, we can play a part to
ensure water sustainability and contribute to climate action by reducing
our carbon footprint. Our involvement is important in playing our part
towards water sustainability.</p>
<p>In celebration of World Water Day, we would like to invite parents to
reinforce this message at home and play our part in action! There will
be planned activities in school in the month of March and our staff will
also support the event by wearing blue to commemorate World Water Day.
Together, we can play our part to contribute to building a sustainable
water future for Singapore.</p>
