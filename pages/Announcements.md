<h3><strong>ALBA's Battery Recycling Challenge</strong> (1 March 2025 to 28 February 2026)</h3>
<p>Our school is proud to take part in this year-long recycling initiative.
We have set up collection points at our school's Green Hub, where grey
recycling bins are available for AA, AAA, AAAA, square, and button batteries.
This programme not only helps recover valuable materials such as zinc,
steel, and manganese but also prevents harmful substances from entering
our environment through improper disposal. We encourage you to pass your
child/ward the used batteries for this recycling initiative.</p>

<p><em>Please refer to the PG letters for more information.</em>

<p><em>Thank you.</em>
