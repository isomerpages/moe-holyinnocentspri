To help our students thrive in a fast-changing world, we have identified competencies that have become increasingly important in the 21st&nbsp;century. These competencies, as outlined in the Framework for 21st&nbsp;Century Competencies and Student Outcomes, illustrate the holistic education that our school provides to better prepare our students for the future.

**The Inquiry Process :**

Inquiry-based learning in the classroom embodies these elements and takes on various possible forms, including those that are more process-oriented and those that are discussion oriented. The inquiry approach used in Social Studies also encompasses an appreciation of the roles and responsibilities of the teacher and student in a classroom culture that would be conducive to inquiry.

The inquiry process can be characterised by four aspects:

·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sparking Curiosity

·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gathering Data

·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exercising Reasoning

·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reflective Thinking

Social Studies ignites curiosity about real-world issues. It helps students to understand and developments that are taking place in society and the world as well as their roles in shaping the future of the nation.
