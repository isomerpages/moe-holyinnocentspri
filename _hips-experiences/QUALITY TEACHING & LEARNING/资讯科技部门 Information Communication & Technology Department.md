<h2><strong>资讯科技部门 <br>Information Communication &amp; Technology Department</strong></h2>
<h4></h4>
<h3><strong>Department Vision</strong></h3>
<p>Technology-transformed learning, to prepare students for a technology-transformed
world</p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>Department Focus</strong></h3>
<p>The school’s ICT department programmes are aligned to the “Transforming
Education through Technology” Masterplan 2030 (EdTech2030), which outlines
how schools can better leverage technology to enhance teaching and learning
in the classrooms.&nbsp;By incorporating e-Pedagogy and digital tools into
our classrooms, we equip our students with the skills necessary to thrive
in a technology-transformed world.</p>
<p>Our alignment with EdTech 2030 also involves preparing students for the
future by incorporating critical digital literacy skills across the curriculum.
One example is our Applied Learning Programme, Digimind@HIPS, which focuses
on fostering competencies in coding and problem-solving through applied
learning and real-world applications.</p>
<p>The ICT department is committed to equipping both students and teachers
with essential digital skills in a digitally-equipped learning environment.
Our focus is on three key areas:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Applying digital literacy and technological skills</strong>&nbsp;to
help students navigate complex problems and contexts in the real-world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fostering a safe online learning environment</strong>&nbsp;by
educating students about cyber wellness and responsible use of technology
in a safe manner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enhance the use of e-Pedagogy</strong> to design effective tech-enabled
learning experiences in the classroom through collaborative professional
learning amongst teachers.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>Student Learning Space (SLS)</strong></h3>
<p>The Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS) is an MOE learning portal that
enhances teaching and learning by transforming learning experiences through
purposeful use of technology. The SLS is a key enabler in supporting schools
in their implementation of the EdTech Masterplan 2030.</p>
<p>Through the SLS, students gain greater ownership of their learning and
engage in collaborative work with their peers. Aligned with the development
of the 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;Century Competencies (21CC), the SLS promotes
self-directed learning and teamwork, fostering a sense of student ownership.</p>

<h3><strong>Cyberwellness</strong></h3>
<p>Beyond developing digitally literate learners who apply digital literacy
and technological skills, a HIPS student would also learn to exercise cyber
wellness to use technology in a safe and discerning manner.</p>
