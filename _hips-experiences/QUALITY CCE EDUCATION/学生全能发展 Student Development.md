## 学生全能发展 <br>Student Development

#### Core Department Beliefs


To discipline is to care.

Every child is a leader.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Student Development Department looks after 2 main aspects of the holistic development of our&nbsp; students -&nbsp;**Behavioural Well-Being**&nbsp;and&nbsp;**Student Leadership Development**.  

#### Behavioural Well-Being


The school adopts a&nbsp;**Win-Win Discipline**&nbsp;approach towards classroom management where we handle discipline challenges at the moment of the disruption with powerful and proven discipline strategies; but more importantly, it targets the root of discipline challenges—students' unfulfilled needs. We also adopt&nbsp;**Restorative Practices (RP)**&nbsp;and have worked towards establishing a restorative culture within the school setting, where positive relationships are developed among all stakeholders of the school. Therefore, the department strives to create a&nbsp;**safe**&nbsp;and&nbsp;**caring**&nbsp;school environment where positive&nbsp;**teacher-student relationship (TSR)**&nbsp;and&nbsp;**peer relationship (PR)**&nbsp;are built.
