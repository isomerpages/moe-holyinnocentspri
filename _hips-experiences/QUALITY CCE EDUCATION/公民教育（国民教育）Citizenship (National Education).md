## 公民教育（国民教育） <br>Citizenship (National Education)

#### Vision


&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To provide students with the knowledge, skills, and values to understand Singapore’s history and appreciate our journey to nationhood; and have confidence in our nation’s future.  

#### Mission


&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To ensure each child is provided with opportunities to explore and examine their identity as Singaporeans and arrive at a common set of ideals and values.  

  

#### Approaches


National Education will be anchored on the following citizenship dispositions, which enable our young to realise their part in the flourishing of their community and nation:

  

*   A Sense of Belonging
*   A Sense of Reality
*   A Sense of Hope
*   The Will to Act
